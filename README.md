First project - Riesling.
<p>One summer evening, I accidentally won a ticket to the Riesling Festival.</p>
<p>WIKI:</p>
<p>Riesling (/ˈriːslɪŋ/, /ˈriːz-/;[1] German: [ˈʁiːslɪŋ] (listen)) is a white grape variety that originated in the Rhine region. Riesling is an aromatic grape variety displaying flowery, almost perfumed, aromas as well as high acidity. It is used to make dry, semi-sweet, sweet, and sparkling white wines. </p>
<p>This project is about riesling, its subspecies, the best representatives, and those that I tried at this festival.</p>
<p>And of course, this project is about data analysis, visualization and a little bit about regular expressions)</p>
